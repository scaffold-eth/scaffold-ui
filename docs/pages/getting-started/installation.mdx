## Setup

### Basic Usage

Import and use components directly:

```tsx
import { Address, Balance } from "@scaffold-eth/ui";

function MyComponent() {
  const address = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890";

  return (
    <div>
      <Address address={address} />
      <Balance address={address} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### With Theme Provider

For consistent theming across your application:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@scaffold-eth/ui";

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
